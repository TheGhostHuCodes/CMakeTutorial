# CMakeTutorial

A set of CMake tutorials that I have worked through while trying to get the
hang of CMake.

- CMakeEnvironment and CMakeProject are from [Cross Platform Test Driven
  Development Environment Using
  CMake](http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/general-programming/cross-platform-test-driven-development-environment-using-cmake-part-1-r2986).
- ToDoList is from [John Lamp's CMake
  Tutorial](https://www.johnlamp.net/cmake-tutorial-1-getting-started.html).
